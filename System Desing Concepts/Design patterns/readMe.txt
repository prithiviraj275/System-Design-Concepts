## Software Design Patterns

### What is Design Patterns?
    Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.


### What is Design Pattern consist?

    Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:
        Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
        Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
        Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
        Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

### Classification of Design Pattern?
    Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

    The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

    The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

    In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns:

    Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

    Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
